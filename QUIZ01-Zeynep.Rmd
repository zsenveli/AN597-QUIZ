```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(curl)
```

For reading in the zombies.csv file:
```{r}
f <- f <- curl("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fuzzyatelin/fuzzyatelin.github.io/master/AN597_Fall17/zombies.csv")
d <- read.csv(f, header = TRUE, sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

For creating a subset of the dataframe that only contains females:
```{r}
fem <- filter(d, gender == "Female")
fem
```

Now extracting the first and last name information from said dataset:
```{r}
femname <- select(fem, first_name, last_name)
femname
```

If I wanted to pipe it:
```{r}
d %>%
filter(gender == "Female") %>%
select(first_name, last_name)
```
